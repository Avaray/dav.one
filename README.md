## üßª My Blog

It's a place where I write about [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/) and where I practice my coding skills. Currently I'm using [Astro](https://astro.build/) because it's a great static site generator and It's [Discord community](https://discord.gg/astrodotbuild) is awesome.

Previously I was using [React](https://react.dev/) SPA (Single Page Application), but that wasn't SEO friendly. Astro resolved all issues I had with that version of the blog.

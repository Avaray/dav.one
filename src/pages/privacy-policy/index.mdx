This **Privacy Policy** applies to the [dav.one](https://dav.one/) website and its preview version available at [next.dav.one](https://next.dav.one/).

**Last Updated:** January 5, 2026

## Overview

This website is a [personal programming project](https://dav.one/about-website/).  
Privacy is respected through minimal data collection practices and cookie-free operation.

## Data Collection

### Technical (HTTP) data

The site is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), 
and **Cloudflare's standard HTTP traffic logging** may record typical request/response metadata. This can include:
- IP address (and derived approximate location, e.g., country/region)
- Date and time of the request
- Requested URL path and query string
- HTTP method (GET/POST/etc.)
- Response status code
- Referrer header (if provided by the browser)
- User-Agent header (browser/device information)

[Cloudflare Web Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/) is **not enabled**.

### Analytics

This website uses two privacy-focused analytics solutions:

**[PostHog Web Analytics](https://posthog.com/web-analytics)** is configured with [in-memory persistence only](https://posthog.com/docs/libraries/js/persistence), meaning no cookies or persistent data are stored in your browser. Data collected is limited to basic usage patterns and is not tied to persistent identifiers.

**[Medama](https://oss.medama.io/methodology/overview)** is a self-hosted analytics platform that collects basic usage data including page views, referrer information, and general device/browser statistics. Being self-hosted, all data remains under my direct control and is not shared with third parties.

## Cookies

This website **does not use** [cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie).

## Data Processing

HTTP request data is processed by Cloudflare Pages as part of the hosting infrastructure. 
For information about your privacy rights and how Cloudflare handles data, see [Cloudflare's Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

Analytics data from Medama.io is processed on my own infrastructure and is not shared with external parties.

## Data Retention

**Cloudflare HTTP logs:** Retained temporarily by Cloudflare for security and infrastructure purposes. Refer to [Cloudflare's Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) for details.

**PostHog Analytics:** With in-memory persistence, data exists only during your active session and is automatically discarded when you close the tab or navigate away. No long-term retention occurs.

**Medama Analytics:** Basic usage statistics are retained on my self-hosted infrastructure for analytical purposes. This data is aggregated and not linked to individual users.

## Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. The "Last Updated" date at the top indicates when changes were last made.

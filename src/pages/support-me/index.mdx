<h3 class="!mt-0">Every person needs support to grow and develop.</h3>

It's enough that you help me solve a coding problem or make the code in my
[public projects](https://github.com/Avaray?tab=repositories) better.\
I would gladly accept that kind of assistance.

If, for any reason, you want to support me financially, you can do so at the following places:

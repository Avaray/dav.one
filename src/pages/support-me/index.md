Every person needs support to grow and develop.

It's enough that you help me solve a coding problem or make the code in my [public projects](https://github.com/Avaray?tab=repositories) better. I would gladly accept that kind of assistance. 

However, I am also open to financial support.  
You can do that by visiting my profiles on: 

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Avaray/)
- [BuyMeACoffee.com](https://buymeacoffee.com/avaray)
- [Patreon.com](https://patreon.com/Avaray_)

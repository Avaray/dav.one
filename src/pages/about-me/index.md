**I'm computer enthusiast, hobbyist programmer and Generative AI artist.**

For half of my life, I've been involved with computers.  
I've always been interested in things related to the web and graphics.
I like to solve problems, automate things, and create new things.
Never planned to threat programming as a profession, but it seems that's what I'm trying to do now. 

Currently, I'm looking for a full-time job as a:
- Generative AI Engineer
- Generative AI Content Creator
- Junior Frontend Developer (React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Astro)
- Junior Backend Developer (Node, Bun)
- Junior Fullstack Developer
- Junior Mobile Developer (React Native, Expo)
- Junior JavaScript Developer
- Junior Manual Tester
- Junior Automation Tester
- Junior IT Support
- ???

In locations:

I'm open to various interesting job proposals, not necessarily limited to coding. I am interested in solving problems within companies, streamlining processes, automation, and surely there's more. I am mature and responsible. Despite my age, I am still interested in new things and like to learn new things.

<span className='text-2xl'>I'm computer enthusiast, hobbyist programmer and Generative AI artist.</span>

For half of my life, I've been involved with computers.  
I've always been interested in things related to the web and graphics.
I like to solve problems, automate things, and create new things.
Never planned to threat programming as a profession, but it seems that's what I'm trying to do now.

I'm open to various interesting job proposals, not necessarily limited to coding. I am interested in solving problems within companies, streamlining processes, automation, and surely there's more. I am mature and responsible. Despite my age, I am still interested in new things and like to learn new things.

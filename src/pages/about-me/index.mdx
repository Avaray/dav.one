<span className='text-2xl'>I'm computer enthusiast, hobbyist programmer and Generative AI artist.</span>

For half of my life, I've been involved with computers.  
I've always been interested in things related to the web and graphics.  
Currently, most of my programming interests and projects are more or less related to JavaScript.
I like to solve problems, automate things, and create new things.

Currently, I'm looking for a full-time job as a:
- Generative AI Engineer / Content Creator (graphics related)

I'm open to various interesting job proposals, not necessarily limited to coding. I am interested in solving problems within companies, streamlining processes, automation, and surely there's more. I am mature and responsible. Despite my age, I am still interested in new things and like to learn new things.

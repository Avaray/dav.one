    For half of my life, I've been involved with computers.  
    I've always been interested in things related to the web and graphics.  
    Most of my programming interests and projects are more or less related to JavaScript.
    I like to solve problems, automate things, and create new things.

    I'm open to various interesting job proposals, not necessarily limited to coding. I am interested in solving problems within companies, streamlining processes, automation, and surely there's more. I am mature and responsible. Despite my age, I am still interested in new things and like to learn new things.

The website you're looking at is the result of my desire to share knowledge on topics that interest me, 
as well as my passion for exploring libraries for creating modern web applications. 
Repository of this website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Avaray/dav.one).

To be able to share an impressive total of <span class="font-bold">{Object.keys(articles).length} articles</span> with the world, I used awesome tools and libraries such as:  

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - a modern static site generator.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - a typed superset of JavaScript.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - a utility-first CSS framework.
- [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) - awesome library of components for Tailwind CSS.
- [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) - a huge library of icons.

Hosting & Deployments:
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) - because of their awesome CDN and clear pricing.
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) - for automatic deployments.

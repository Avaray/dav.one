## Applications

- [Stability Matrix](https://github.com/LykosAI/StabilityMatrix) - a Multi-Platform Package Manager for Stable
  Diffusion. You can use it to download and run your favorite UI locally without unnecessary configuration.
- [LynxHub](https://github.com/KindaBrazy/LynxHub) - another Multi-Platform Package Manager for Stable Diffusion. It's a
  newer tool than Stability Matrix. Released in August 2024.
- [AI-Dock](https://github.com/ai-dock) - containerized UIs like
  [Forge](https://github.com/ai-dock/stable-diffusion-webui-forge)
  [Automatic1111](https://github.com/ai-dock/stable-diffusion-webui), [ComfyUI](https://github.com/ai-dock/comfyui),
  [InvokeAI](https://github.com/ai-dock/invokeai), and [Fooocus](https://github.com/ai-dock/fooocus). You can run them
  on your local machine or on a
  [rented server](http://localhost:4321/useful-links-for-daily-work-with-stable-diffusion#server-rentals).
- [chaiNNer](https://chainner.app/) - a node-based image processing GUI aimed at making chaining image processing tasks
  easy and customizable. You can find Upscalers on [OpenModelDB](https://openmodeldb.info/).

## Models

- [CivitAI.com](https://civitai.com/?ref_code=ADD-THI) - the best place to find great Checkpoints, Lora's, Embeddings
  and more. Almost every model has some images generated using it. So you can easily find out if it's worth downloading.
  Also it's a great place for inspiration.
- [HuggingFace.co](https://huggingface.co/) - a platform for sharing and deploying AI models.\
  I recommend checking out the [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces?sort=trending&search=sdxl) section and especially
  [Diffusers Gallery](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/diffusers-gallery).
- [OpenModelDB](https://openmodeldb.info/) - a community driven database of AI Upscaling models.

## Server rentals

- [Vast.ai](https://cloud.vast.ai/?ref_id=62878&creator_id=42512&name=null) - a great place to rent a server for your
  work. You can find there a lot of different configurations and prices. Servers are located around the world. This
  service has the best prices.
- [Runpod.io](https://runpod.io?ref=gzvzzzv9) - a bit more expensive than Vast and has a worse server browser, but itâ€™s
  still a good place to rent a server.

## Styles and Studies

- [SDXL Artistic Studies](https://rikkar69.github.io/SDXL-artist-study/) - awesome studies on
  [Artists](https://rikkar69.github.io/SDXL-artist-study/tags/),
  [Art Mediums](https://rikkar69.github.io/SDXL-artist-study/art-mediums/),
  [Art Movements](https://rikkar69.github.io/SDXL-artist-study/art-movements/),
  [Camera Models](https://rikkar69.github.io/SDXL-artist-study/cameras/),
  [Camera Films](https://rikkar69.github.io/SDXL-artist-study/film/). I highly recommend last two, because they are very
  useful in realistic photography generation.
- [SDXL Artist Style Studies](https://sdxl.parrotzone.art/) - probably the biggest collection of artist styles for SDXL.
  Unfortunately, images seems to be broken currently.
- [Stable Diffusion 1.5 Artists Cheat Sheet](https://supagruen.github.io/StableDiffusion-CheatSheet/) - a cheat sheet
  for Stable Diffusion 1.5. Might not work with newer models like SDXL.
- [Lighting Types in SDXL](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1cjwi04/made_this_lighting_guide_for_myself_thought_id/) -
  a Reddit post showing different lighting types in SDXL.
- [Nationalities in Stable Diffusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/13oea0i/photorealistic_portraits_of_200_ethinicities/) -
  a Reddit post showing different nationalities in Stable Diffusion 1.5. It works with SDXL too.

## Tools

- [CLIP Interrogator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pharmapsychotic/CLIP-Interrogator) - analyzes images and generates
  descriptive text prompts for SD1 & SDXL. [This one](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fffiloni/CLIP-Interrogator-2) is for
  SD2 and [this one](https://huggingface.co/spaces/deepghs/wd14_tagging_online) is for Pony Diffusion.
- [Diffusion Tokenizer](https://sd-tokenizer.rocker.boo/) - converts text prompts into numerical tokens used by
  diffusion models.

## Tutorials

- [stable-diffusion-art.com](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/tutorials/) - a great website with many useful tutorials.
  Each tutorial is focused on a specific topic. You can find basics as well as more advanced tutorials there.
- [Articles @ CivitAI.com](https://civitai.com/articles?ref_code=ADD-THI) - there are many guides created by the
  community. Some are great and some are useless. You need to find good ones by yourself.

## Communities

  [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/stable-image) and [Flux](https://blackforestlabs.ai/) models. You can find
  there many interesting works and discussions. That's also a good place to ask for help if you have any problems with
  your work.

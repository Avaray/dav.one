## Intro

[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) is one of the best options for hosting [static websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page), 
primarily due to its robust [Content Delivery Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) (CDN) and [cost-effective pricing](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/), 
including a generous free tier. The platform delivers excellent performance and global reach. 
For many projects, integrating Cloudflare Pages with a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository allows for straightforward automated deployments: 
[changes pushed to the repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commit_(version_control)) trigger automatic builds and deployments.

However, [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/), 
Cloudflare's official [command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) (CLI), 
currently supports only [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm), [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/motivation), 
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), and [Bun](https://bun.sh/). Making it harder to deploy [Deno](https://deno.com/) projects to Cloudflare Pages.

The solution might involve using [Node's package.json](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/configuration/#package.json-support) to enable Wrangler to build your project. However, if you prefer a pure Deno project, you can use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for automated deployments. This article demonstrates how to accomplish that.

## Disable automatic deployments

I assume you already have a GitHub repository connected to [Cloudflare Workers & Pages](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages).

- Navigate to your project in [Workers & Pages](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages).
- Open the project settings.
- In "Branch Control" uncheck "Automatic Deployments" and set "Preview Branch" to "None". Then click "Save".

## Get your Account ID

- Navigate to your project in [Workers & Pages](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages).
- Copy your Account ID from Account details (should be visible on the right side).

## Generate API Token

<div role="alert" class="alert alert-warning alert-soft w-fit font-bold">
  <span>Only if you don't have one</span>
</div>

- Right below the Account ID (in account details), click [Manage API tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).
- Click "Create Token".
- Find "Create Custom Token" and click button "Get started" located next to it.
- Fill "Token name" field as you like.
- In Permissions set "Account" > "Cloudflare Pages" > "Edit".
- In Account Resources set your Account (optional).
- Click "Continue to summary" button. Then click "Create Token" button.
- Copy your new API Token.

## Set Account ID and API Token as Secrets in repository

- Navigate to your repository in [GitHub](https://github.com/).
- Open the repository settings.
- Open "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
- Click "New repository secret" button.
- Set name to `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, value to your Account ID, and click "Add secret" button.
- Click "New repository secret" button.
- Set name to `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, value to your API Token, and click "Add secret" button.
- Done.

## GitHub Actions Workflow file

You need to create a [workflow file](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/quickstart#creating-your-first-workflow) in your repository. 
The following code will install Deno, install dependencies, build your project, and deploy it to Cloudflare Pages.

```
name: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Build and Deploy
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Deno
        uses: denoland/setup-deno@v2
        with:
          deno-version: v2.x

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: deno install --allow-scripts

      - name: Build Website
        run: deno task build

      - name: Install Wrangler
        run: deno install --global --allow-scripts npm:wrangler@latest

      - name: Deploy Website to Cloudflare
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
          accountId: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID }}
          command: pages deploy ./dist --project-name=awesome --branch=main --commit-dirty=true 
```

## Final notes

- The workflow file is just an example. You need to adapt it to your needs.
- This workflow will be launched only if you push changes to the **main** branch. 
  If your branch name is different, change it in the workflow file.
- Change `--project-name=awesome` to your project name (the one you set in Cloudflare Pages).
- You can change [the event that triggers the workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#about-events-that-trigger-workflows).
- **Install Dependencies** step might be unecessary. It depends on your project setup.
- Your build output directory might be different. In this example it is **dist**.
- `--commit-dirty=true` prevents Wrangler from building your project.

import Icon from '@xtreat/astro-iconify';
import Tabs from 'Tabs.astro';
import TabsSync from 'TabsSync.astro';

<TabsSync />

## 1. Initialize your new [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) project 
{/* {#startsa} */}

Initialize new project by running the following command in your terminal.  
Command will launch a [CLI wizard](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#install-from-the-cli-wizard) to setup your project.  
Setup a project as you like. **Just don't install dependencies during the setup process.** You will do that later.

export const initialization = [
  { label: "Deno", content: "deno -A npm:create-astro@latest" },
  { label: "Bun", content: "bunx create-astro@latest" },
  { label: "NPM", content: "npm create astro@latest" },
  { label: "PNPM", content: "pnpm create astro@latest" },
  { label: "Yarn", content: "yarn create astro" },
];

<Tabs tabs={initialization} name="initialization" />

## 2. Install Dependencies

export const dependencies = [
  { label: "Deno", content: "deno i --allow-scripts npm:vite@latest npm:tailwindcss npm:@tailwindcss/vite\ndeno i -D npm:daisyui" },
  { label: "Bun", content: "bun i vite@latest tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite\nbun i -D daisyui" },
  { label: "NPM", content: "npm i vite@latest tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite\nnpm i -D daisyui" },
  { label: "PNPM", content: "pnpm add vite@latest tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite\npnpm add -D daisyui" },
  { label: "Yarn", content: "yarn add vite@latest tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite\nyarn add -D daisyui" },
];

<Tabs tabs={dependencies} name="dependencies" />

## 3. Configure Astro

Open project in your favorite editor. If it's [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can also install official [Astro extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode).

Edit the **astro.config.mjs** file, located in the root of your project. You need to add [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) as a [Vite plugin](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/add-yaml-support/).

```
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  vite: {
    plugins: [tailwindcss()],
  },
});
```

## 4. Add Tailwind CSS and daisyUI to your CSS

To make [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [daisyUI](daisyui.com) available in your project, you need to add them to your [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) file.
You can make it available globally or locally. Everything depends on your needs.
In following examples, we will make them available globally.

src/styles/**global.css**
```
@import "tailwindcss";
@plugin "daisyui";
```

Then, import CSS file in the **.astro** component like this:
```
---
import '../proper/path/to/styles/global.css';
---
```

Another way to import the CSS file in the **.astro** component:

```
<style is:global>
  @import '../proper/path/to/styles/global.css';
</style>
```

If you are not planning to use CSS files at all, you can import them in **.astro** component like this:

```
<style is:global>
  @import "tailwindcss";
  @plugin "daisyui";
</style>
```

<div class='flex items-center my-12 gap-4' {...props}>
  <div><Icon icon="game-icons:coronation" class='h-40 w-40 text-primary' /></div>
  <div class='flex flex-col'>
    <div class='flex gap-6 text-5xl mt-6 font-bold text-primary animate-bounce transform -translate-x-[52px]'>
      <Icon icon="game-icons:arrow-dunk" class="flip-x" />
      <span class="select-none">YOU DID IT!</span>
    </div>
    <div>
        At this point, you should be able to use **Tailwind CSS** and **daisyUI** in your project.  
        Run the following command in your terminal to start **Development Mode**.
  </div>
  </div>
</div>

export const run = [
  { label: 'Deno', content: 'deno task dev' },
  { label: 'Bun', content: 'bun run dev' },
  { label: 'NPM', content: 'npm run dev' },
  { label: 'PNPM', content: 'pnpm dev' },
  { label: 'Yarn', content: 'yarn dev' },
]

<Tabs tabs={run} name="run" />

If you want, you can take a few additional steps that might be useful to you.

## 5. Configure Tailwind CSS (optional)

If you are not planning to use [default color palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors#default-color-palette-reference), [you can disable it](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors#disabling-default-colors).  
This will reduce the size of your CSS file by about 3kB ([gzipped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip)). 

```
@theme {
  --color-*: initial;
}
```

## 6. Configure daisyUI (optional)

By default, [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) has two themes: **light** and **dark** and you don't need to configure anything to make it work. 
They adjust according to the user's settings (browser/system). 
However, you can customize it as you like. Check [Config](https://v5.daisyui.com/docs/config/) and [Themes](https://v5.daisyui.com/docs/themes/) pages for more information. 
In this example, four themes are specified. **Cupcake** is the default theme. **Forest** will be used if the user has dark mode enabled.

```
@plugin "daisyui" {
  themes: light, dark, cupcake --default, forest --prefersdark;
};
```

## 7. Add Typography plugin (optional)

By default, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) resets all styles. If you're planning to create a **blog** or other text-based content, you should consider adding typography plugin.
To make [Typography](https://tailwindcss-typography.vercel.app/) available in your project, first you need to install package.

export const typography = [
  { label: "Deno", content: "deno i -D npm:@tailwindcss/typography" },
  { label: "Bun", content: "bun i -D @tailwindcss/typography" },
  { label: "NPM", content: "npm i -D @tailwindcss/typography" },
  { label: "PNPM", content: "pnpm add -D @tailwindcss/typography" },
  { label: "Yarn", content: "yarn add -D @tailwindcss/typography" },
];

<Tabs tabs={typography} name="typography" />

Add plugin in your CSS file.

```
@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography";
```

Finally add the **prose** class somewhere in your project, for example, to your **body** tag.  
Everything inside the **body** tag will be affected by [Tailwind CSS Typography](https://tailwindcss-typography.vercel.app/).

```
<body class="prose">
```

I recommend reading [official documentation](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography?tab=readme-ov-file#applying-a-type-scale) and [this page of daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/docs/layout-and-typography/) to learn more.  
Also, be aware that using [@apply](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles#extracting-classes-with-apply) with class **prose** in your CSS may cause issues.

## 8. Add custom fonts (optional)

You can use [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) and its [web-fonts](https://unocss.dev/presets/web-fonts) preset to add custom fonts to your project.  
This will let you use web fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), [Bunny](https://fonts.bunny.net/), and [FontShare](https://www.fontshare.com/) by simply providing the font names.

export const fonts = [
  { label: "Deno", content: "deno i -D npm:unocss" },
  { label: "Bun", content: "bun i -D unocss" },
  { label: "NPM", content: "npm i -D unocss" },
  { label: "PNPM", content: "pnpm add -D unocss" },
  { label: "Yarn", content: "yarn add -D unocss" },
]

<Tabs tabs={fonts} name="fonts" />

Add **UnoCSS** to **integrations list** in your **astro.config.mjs** config file and [configure it](https://unocss.dev/presets/web-fonts#options).  
You can also keep your UnoCSS configuration [in a dedicated file](https://unocss.dev/integrations/astro) to keep Astro config file cleaner.


```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import UnoCSS from 'unocss/astro'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [UnoCSS({
    presets: [
      presetWebFonts({
        provider: 'google',
        fonts: {
          firamono: 'Fira Mono:400',
          roboto: 'Roboto:200,400,700',
        },
      })
    ]
  })],
});
```

Now you can use fonts in **CSS** for specific [Themes](https://v5.daisyui.com/docs/themes/).  
Fonts will be loaded in moments when you switch between themes.

```
[data-theme="dark"] {
  font-family: 'Fira Mono';
}
```

Or you can use them in classic way.

```
body {
  font-family: 'Roboto';
}
```

## 9. Add SVG Icons (optional)

Recently [Xander Treat](https://xtreat.dev/) created [@xtreat/astro-iconify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xtreat/astro-iconify) package to make it easy to use [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) icons in your [Astro](https://astro.build/) projects.  
Comparing to other SVG icon [integrations](https://astro.build/integrations/?search=icon), this one lets you use any icons from [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) without hassles.  
To search for icons, I recommend [Icones](https://icones.js.org/) website, created by [Anthony Fu](https://antfu.me/).  

To install icons in your project, run the following command in your terminal.

{/* Need to fix those commands, because they were generated by AI */}
export const icons = [
  { label: "Deno", content: "deno i npm:@xtreat/astro-iconify" },
  { label: "Bun", content: "bun i @xtreat/astro-iconify" },
  { label: "NPM", content: "npm i @xtreat/astro-iconify" },
  { label: "PNPM", content: "pnpm add @xtreat/astro-iconify" },
  { label: "Yarn", content: "yarn add @xtreat/astro-iconify" },
];

<Tabs tabs={icons} name="icons" />

Then you will be able to use icons in **.astro** files like:

```
---
import Icon from "@xtreat/astro-iconify";
---

<Icon class="h-42 w-42" icon="game-icons:balloon-dog" />
```

Or in [MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) files like:

```
import Icon from '@xtreat/astro-iconify';

<Icon class="h-42 w-42" icon="game-icons:balloon-dog" />
```

## 10. Add React (optional)

[Astro](https://astro.build/) lets you use popular frameworks, such as [React](https://react.dev/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (even in the same time!).  
To add them, you should follow [integration guides](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/) and [daisyUI guides](https://v5.daisyui.com/docs/install/#framework-install-tutorials).

For this tutorial, we will add [React](https://react.dev/) framework manually.  
To install it in your project, run the following command in your terminal.

export const react = [
  { label: "Deno", content: "deno i --allow-scripts npm:@astrojs/react npm:react npm:react-dom npm:@types/react npm:@types/react-dom" },
  { label: "Bun", content: "bun i @astrojs/react react react-dom @types/react @types/react-dom" },
  { label: "NPM", content: "npm i @astrojs/react react react-dom @types/react @types/react-dom" },
  { label: "PNPM", content: "pnpm add @astrojs/react react react-dom @types/react @types/react-dom" },
  { label: "Yarn", content: "yarn add @astrojs/react react react-dom @types/react @types/react-dom" },
];

<Tabs tabs={react} name="react" />

Edit the **astro.config.mjs** configuration file again. Add [React](https://react.dev/) to the [integrations list](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/#manual-installation).

```
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import react from "@astrojs/react";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [react()],
});
```

If you are using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) in your project, then you need to edit the **tsconfig.json** file located in the root of your project.  
Add the following lines to **compilerOptions** section.

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "jsxImportSource": "react"
  }
}
```

## 11. Recommended Integrations (optional)

If you chose **Basic, minimal starter** at the beginning of this tutorial, then you may also consider the following integrations.  
I will not cover them in this tutorial, but I believe you will be able to add them yourself.

- [MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/)  
- [Sitemap](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/sitemap/)

description: "For over two years, I've been observing the Stable Diffusion scene. I've generated tens of thousands of images in various ways. Most of them unnecessarily. In this article, I want to share my brief thoughts on a few topics related to Stable Diffusion."

## Intro

The turn of 2022/2023 was, in my opinion, a key moment in the world of computer
graphics. This was when the Stable Diffusion 1.5 model entered the scene and
made a significant impact in the Gen-AI world. At that time, it was one of the
best models, and most importantlyâ€”it was available for free. Anyone could use it
on their own computer, as long as the hardware specifications allowed it.

## Competition

Competition is higher nowadays, difficult to get on top with graphics, a lot of
spam with low quality images, bots, etc.

## Never solved problems

Fingers, hands, arms, legs, etc. Flux is better in those, but worse in others.

## Models

## Community, trends

## Server Rentals, prices and days when is cheaper

## Intro

The turn of 2022/2023 was, in my opinion, a key moment in the world of computer
graphics. This was when the Stable Diffusion 1.5 model entered the scene and
made a significant impact in the Gen-AI world. At that time, it was one of the
best models, and most importantlyâ€”it was available for free. Anyone could use it
on their own computer, as long as the hardware specifications allowed it.

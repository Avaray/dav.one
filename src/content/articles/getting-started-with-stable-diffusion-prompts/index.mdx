## What are Prompts in Stable Diffusion?

Prompts are text descriptions that tell Stable Diffusion what image to generate. 
They act as instructions that guide the AI model to create visual content matching your vision. 
When you type a prompt, the system converts your words into numerical data that controls the image generation process.

## How Prompts work

Stable Diffusion transforms your [text into tokens](https://sd-tokenizer.rocker.boo/) through a process called tokenization. 
The model starts with random noise and gradually refines it over multiple steps, with each step guided by your prompt's encoded information. 
This continues until a coherent image emerges that matches your description.

Prompt structure plays a crucial role in determining the final output. 
Word order significantly impacts the generation process, with terms placed at the beginning of prompts receiving greater emphasis from the model. 
Specificity in your descriptions leads to more predictable and refined results, as detailed prompts provide clearer guidance to the AI. 
Effective prompts typically include **medium**, **medium boosters**, **subject**, **subject details**, **environment**, and **additional modifiers**. 

## Adjusting Emphasis

Stable Diffusion allows you to [adjust the attention](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/features#attentionemphasis) to each keyword. 
You have several options for changing emphasis. 
I recommend using the following format: `(keyword:1.2)` that increases emphasis to 1.2 or `(keyword:0.5)` that decreases emphasis to 0.5.
You can apply emphasis in both, positive and negative prompts.

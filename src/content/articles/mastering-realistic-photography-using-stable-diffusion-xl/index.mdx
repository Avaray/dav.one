## Introduction

I began using [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion) in 2022 when AI image tools became very popular. 
I was excited to make pictures but did not learn enough about how Stable Diffusion works. 
Instead, I copied prompts and settings from others. This mistake slowed me down. 
I believe Stable Diffusion in moment of writing this article is still one of the most popular image generation tools, 
so here are tips I wish I had.

## What are Prompts in Stable Diffusion?

Prompts are text descriptions that tell Stable Diffusion what image to generate. 
They act as instructions that guide the AI model to create visual content matching your vision. 
When you type a prompt, the system converts your words into numerical data that controls the image generation process.

## How Prompts work

Stable Diffusion transforms your [text into tokens](https://sd-tokenizer.rocker.boo/) through a process called tokenization. 
The model starts with random noise and gradually refines it over multiple steps, with each step guided by your prompt's encoded information. 
This continues until a coherent image emerges that matches your description.

Prompt structure plays a crucial role in determining the final output. 
Word order significantly impacts the generation process, with terms placed at the beginning of prompts receiving greater emphasis from the model. 
Specificity in your descriptions leads to more predictable and refined results, as detailed prompts provide clearer guidance to the AI. 

## Prompt Structure Components

Effective prompts typically include **medium**, **subject**, **style**, **technical details**, and **additional modifiers**.

## Common misconception: Using "Realism" for Realistic images

Many people believe that adding the word "realism" or "photorealistic" to their prompts will produce more realistic-looking images. 
However, this is actually a significant misunderstanding that can lead to unexpected results.

The terms "realism" and "photorealistic" are primarily associated with [art styles](https://rikkar69.github.io/SDXL-artist-study/art-movements/) rather than actual photography. 
When you use these words in your prompts, you're essentially asking the AI to create an artistic interpretation that mimics reality, not to create something that looks like an actual photograph.

## Better alternatives for true Photographic results

To generate images that look like actual photographs in Stable Diffusion, you should:

- Use photography-specific terminology. Use the keywords like "photo", "photograph" or "photography". You should place these keywords at the beginning of your prompt. 
- Add keywords like "studio lighting", "rim lighting", or "golden hour". These keywords help create more realistic lighting conditions typical of professional photography. 
- Specify camera equipment and film. You can specify camera brands like "Kodak", "Fujifilm", or "Nikon". Equipment like "85mm lens" or "f/2.8 aperture". Film types like "Kodak Portra 160" or "Rollei Infrared 400". 

## Negative Prompt

The Negative Prompt tells the AI what it should avoid in the generated image. 
In case of generating realistic photography, you should specify what you don't want to see.

- Things that make the image look bad like "low quality", "low resolution", "grainy", "pixelated" or "distorted". 
- Media types like "illustration", "cartoon", "painting", "3D render", or "artwork".
- Elements like "text", "watermark", "signature", "error" or "artifact".

## Adjusting Emphasis

Stable Diffusion allows you to [adjust the attention](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/features#attentionemphasis) to each keyword. 
You have several options for changing emphasis. 
I recommend using the following format: `(keyword:1.2)` that increases emphasis to 1.2 or `(keyword:0.5)` that decreases emphasis to 0.5.
You can apply emphasis in both, positive and negative prompts.

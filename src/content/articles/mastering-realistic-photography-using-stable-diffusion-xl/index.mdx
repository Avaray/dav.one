## Common misconception: Using "Realism" for Realistic images

Many people believe that adding the word "realism" or "photorealistic" to their prompts will produce more realistic-looking images. 
However, this is actually a significant misunderstanding that can lead to unexpected results.

The terms "realism" and "photorealistic" are primarily associated with [art styles](https://rikkar69.github.io/SDXL-artist-study/art-movements/) rather than actual photography. 
When you use these words in your prompts, you're essentially asking the AI to create an artistic interpretation that mimics reality, not to create something that looks like an actual photograph.

## Better alternatives for true Photographic results

To generate images that look like actual photographs in Stable Diffusion, you should:

- Use photography-specific terminology. Use the keywords like "photo", "photograph" or "photography". You should place these keywords at the beginning of your prompt. 
- Add keywords like "studio lighting", "rim lighting", or "golden hour". These keywords help create more realistic lighting conditions typical of professional photography. 
- Specify camera equipment and film. You can specify camera brands like "Kodak", "Fujifilm", or "Nikon". Equipment like "85mm lens" or "f/2.8 aperture". Film types like "Kodak Portra 160" or "Rollei Infrared 400".

## Negative Prompt

The Negative Prompt tells the AI what it should avoid in the generated image. 
In case of generating realistic photography, you should specify what you don't want to see.

- Things that make the image look bad like "low quality", "low resolution", "grainy", "pixelated" or "distorted". 
- Media types like "illustration", "cartoon", "painting", "3D render", or "artwork".
- Elements like "text", "watermark", "signature", "error" or "artifact".
